It was 2010, I came home after a long day of setting up for the next days pep rallies and sat down in front of my beast of a lenovo laptop to begin my english essay for the week. 

To my complete surprise my screen flashed multiple times, turned its head 360 degrees, started speaking latin and then turned the dreaded blue. It was infected, and intruder was in our midst and it had infested my poor laptop with its malovelant tendrils of terror. The Blue Screen of Death stared me in the face as I contemplated how I was going to finish my essay, due tomorrow morning, in time. 

Enter my white knight, Jason, a close friend who was glued to computers at home playing dota2 for what seemed like eons. I rang him up and cried into the situation of my newly possesed computer as it vomitted split pea soup behind me. Less than half an hour later he was sitting in front of my "hunk of cr**" slamming at the keyboard with speed only seen in the matrix. A few hours later it was exorcised, I asked my digital priest what this magic was and there I was introduced to my future mistress, coding. 

This was the seed of interest that finally reached maturity earlier this year. I was frustrated with how ugly and difficult the use of a website my friend was making. I spouted out grandiose ideas about how amazing it would be if when you did this the website did this, or if this looked this way, how aesthetically pleasing it could be. She huffed about how I had no idea how much work that would take and I decided that I wanted to try. After proving her right, my fire was stoked, being the highly competitive, ambitious, unhinged geek that I am.  I took my first real steps into the world of web devlopment. I started googling and stumbled on The Odin Project, and dove head first. I had ads popping up in my insta feed and the sidebars of websites I was purusing and finally clicked through to Flatiron, which, I obviously applied to, and here we are!

So let us begin!
